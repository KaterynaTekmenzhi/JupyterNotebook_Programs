The files contained in this repositary are fun games and projects practicing the functions and modules in Python.

Collectively all the files go over these basic concepts of jupyter notebook/python programming language.

Knowledge objectives
- identify what resources are needed to write and run a Python program
- use a code editor
- write your first Python program
- run a Python program
- create variables in Python
- comment your code
- print output to the screen
- ask for user input
- assign user input to a variable

- create statements to perform arithmetic 
- join strings together
- use the print() and input() functions
- use the int(), float() and round() functions
- compare strings
- understand the purpose of pseudocode
- use Boolean expressions
- use if/else if/else statements
- code while statements
- code for statements
- use break and continue statements

- define a function
- call a function
- call a main() function
- use default arguments
- use named arguments
- know when to use local vs. global variables
- create a module
- document a module
- import a module
- use the random module

- create a simple test plan to test a program
- create a list 
- get and set items in a list
- add and remove items in a list
- process items in a list
- pass a list to a function
- work with multidimensional lists
- perform list functions like count, reverse, and sort items in a list
- copy and slice a list
- know the difference between a list and a tuple

- Describe how an item in a list is accessed.
- Describe the use of these list methods: append(), insert(), remove(), index(), and pop().
- Distinguish between the way mutable types like a list are passed to and returned by functions and the way immutable types like integers are passed to and returned by functions.
- Describe the use of a list of lists.
- Describe the use of these functions with lists: count(), reverse(),
sort(), min(), max(), choice(), shuffle(), and deepcopy().6. Differentiate between a shallow copy of a list and a deep copy.
- Distinguish between a tuple and a list.
- Describe the use of a multiple assignment statement when you unpack a tuple.

- open and close a file
- write to a text file
- read from a text file
- work with a list in a text file
- write to a CSV file
- read from a CSV file
- describe what an exception is
- use a try statement to handle an exception
- handle a single exception
- handle multiple exceptions
