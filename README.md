# jupyternotebook

The files contained in this repositary are fun games and projects practicing the functions and modules in Python.

Collectively all the files go over these basic concepts of jupyter notebook/python programming language.

Knowledge objectives
- identify what resources are needed to write and run a Python program
- use a code editor
- write your first Python program
- run a Python program
- create variables in Python
- comment your code
- print output to the screen
- ask for user input
- assign user input to a variable

- create statements to perform arithmetic 
- join strings together
- use the print() and input() functions
- use the int(), float() and round() functions
- compare strings
- understand the purpose of pseudocode
- use Boolean expressions
- use if/else if/else statements
- code while statements
- code for statements
- use break and continue statements

- define a function
- call a function
- call a main() function
- use default arguments
- use named arguments
- know when to use local vs. global variables
- create a module
- document a module
- import a module
- use the random module

- create a simple test plan to test a program
- create a list 
- get and set items in a list
- add and remove items in a list
- process items in a list
- pass a list to a function
- work with multidimensional lists
- perform list functions like count, reverse, and sort items in a list
- copy and slice a list
- know the difference between a list and a tuple

1. Describe how an item in a list is accessed.
2. Describe the use of these list methods: append(), insert(), remove(), index(), and pop().
3. Distinguish between the way mutable types like a list are passed to and returned by functions and the way immutable types like integers are passed to and returned by functions.
4. Describe the use of a list of lists.
5. Describe the use of these functions with lists: count(), reverse(),
sort(), min(), max(), choice(), shuffle(), and deepcopy().
6. Differentiate between a shallow copy of a list and a deep copy.
7. Distinguish between a tuple and a list.
8. Describe the use of a multiple assignment statement when you unpack a tuple.
