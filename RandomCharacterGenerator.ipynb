    "# 1. Ask if the user would like to create a character. If the user answers yes, then the program should continue. If the user answers no, then the program should end.\n",
    "# 2. Ask for a character name. Or provide a name for them. \n",
    "# 3. import and use the random module\n",
    "# 4. generate at least 5 characteristics of a character (such as strength, intellect, hit points, wisdom, charisma, etc.) and assign a random value to each of them. \n",
    "# 5. Use at least 2 functions in your program. One of the functions must pass a parameter.\n",
    "# 6. Use a random number and if statement to generate a class/race or character type (such as human warrior, or alien from Mars, etc.) \n",
